                is a web application I developed to promote safe browsing
                practices by fostering an interactive, educational environment.
                The platform empowers users to learn about online safety through
                discussions and educational videos, while a badge system
                encourages consistent engagement. With user authentication,
                individuals can create accounts, log in to access personalized
                features, and track their progress. This login functionality
                ensures a secure and customized experience for each user,
                allowing them to participate in discussions, comment on videos,
                and earn activity-based badges.

              Here's an updated portfolio entry for larger.world: larger.world
              Description: As part of a team of three, I collaborated with my
              colleagues Alen Kadrieski and Andrej Zlatev from our academy to
              develop larger.world for a real client. This platform introduces
              users to the concept of "unlearning" as a pathway toward building
              a sustainable and inclusive world. Our goal was to create a
              user-friendly and visually engaging experience that encourages
              users to explore the platform’s resources and join the community.
            </p>
            <p>
              I contributed to both front-end development and user experience
              design. My responsibilities included implementing the horizontal
              scroll for the world view and ensuring a smooth navigation
              experience, all while aligning with the client’s vision and the
              platform’s mission for sustainability and inclusivity.
